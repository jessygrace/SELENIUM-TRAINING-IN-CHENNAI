<strong>What is Selenium?</strong></p>

<p>Selenium is a test automation framework used to test web applications such as browsers. It contains different types of software tools to execute automated testing in numerous approaches. These tools include Selenium Webdriver, IDE, Remote Control (Remote Control), and much more. It supports screening on multiple browsers as well as on multiple OS platforms including Windows, Linux and more platforms.</p>

<p><u><strong>The entire Selenium Tool Suite is comprised of four parts:</strong></u></p>

<ol>
	<li>Selenium IDE, a Firefox add-on you could simply use in creating comparatively simple test cases and test suites.</li>
	<li>Selenium Remote-Control, also called Selenium 1, which is the initial Selenium tool that allowed users to make use of programming languages in producing sophisticated tests.</li>
	<li>WebDriver, the more recent breakthrough that allows your test scripts to communicate straight to the browser, thus controlling it from the os-level.</li>
	<li>Selenium Gridis also a device that is used with Selenium RC to run concurrent evaluations across different browsers and operating systems.</li>
	<li>Selenium RC and WebDriver was merged to to create Selenium 2.</li>
	<li>Selenium is more beneficial than QTP in relation to costs and flexibility.</li>
	<li>Additionally, it lets you run tests in parallel, unlike in QTP where you are only permitted to operate tests sequentially.</li>
</ol>
